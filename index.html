All Microsoft 365 apps, including emails, chats, calendars, documents, contacts, and meetings, will support this ‘Business Chat’ experience.</p>
                <p>Copilot can be thought of as your virtual assistant. You may request that it inform your staff of the new marketing plan that was chosen at the morning meeting, for example. Using the emails, meetings, and texts from that morning, Copilot may then produce an update. Because Copilot is an AI that is constantly learning, its replies won’t always be the best.</p>
                <p>Copilot will undoubtedly get better over time, but you may always make corrections, offer suggestions, and modify whatever it produces before submitting. Find out why utilising Microsoft Teams is the best option for your business if you aren’t already using it.</p>
                <p>Copilot can also be useful for a variety of other things, like account setup and licence management. By using the app, you may create new employee accounts and guarantee that each employee has access to the information and resources necessary for their position.</p>
                <p>Copilot can simplify the process of managing your licences, including making sure you have the appropriate quantity of licences and aren’t paying for unused apps. Because Copilot can help you troubleshoot and solve issues fast and effectively, troubleshooting becomes much more simplified as well.</p>
                <p>Last but not least, Copilot can assist with security configuration, which is crucial for protecting your company’s data.

                <p>To simplify it, let’s look at it in the following categories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li style="padding-top: 20px;"><b>Training of Large Language Models (LLMs):</b> LLMs used in Microsoft 365 Copilot are trained on vast amounts of public data, including books, articles, and websites. This training enables them to understand language, context, and meaning. Users interact with LLMs by providing prompts, which are typically statements or questions.</li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><b>Generating Responses:</b> When a user submits a prompt, the LLM generates a response based on its training and understanding of context. The LLM can also consider additional context provided in the prompt to refine its response. The conversation history is temporary and wiped clean with each new conversation, and the LLM does not use the knowledge from interactions to train itself.</li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><b>Customising Prompts:</b>  It allows users to customise prompts to include additional information that the LLM can refer to when generating responses. This customization allows users to provide context for more accurate responses.</li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><b>Microsoft 365 Copilot Components:</b> The script highlights several core components of Microsoft 365 Copilot:
                    <ul>
                        <li style="padding-top: 5px; list-style-type: disc;"><b>Large Language Models:</b> Copilot uses its private instances of LLMs hosted in the Microsoft Cloud, not the public OpenAI service.</li>
                        <li style="padding-top: 5px; list-style-type: disc;"><b>Orchestration Engine:</b> Copilot is a powerful orchestration engine that helps it understand user intent and context.</li>
                        <li style="padding-top: 5px; list-style-type: disc;"><b>Integration with Microsoft 365 Apps:</b> Copilot’s capabilities are integrated into various Microsoft 365 applications, making it accessible across the suite.</li>
                        <li style="padding-top: 5px; list-style-type: disc;"><b>Information Retrieval:</b> Microsoft Search is used to retrieve information relevant to prompts.</li>
                        <li style="padding-top: 5px; list-style-type: disc;"><b>Microsoft Graph:</b> Microsoft Graph provides information about relationships and activities within the organisation’s data.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><b>Respecting Permissions:</b> Microsoft 365 Copilot respects user access permissions to organisational content and Graph information. It generates responses based on information that users have explicit permission to access.</li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><b>Generating Content:</b> Copilot helps users in generating content within Microsoft 365 applications they are working in. For instance, it can generate a draft proposal by combining its training on proposal structure and content with relevant inputs from other documents that the user has selected. This saves users time and provides a starting point for their work.</li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><b>Data Privacy and Security:</b> The script emphasises that Copilot only uses enterprise data as part of the prompt to the LLM. These prompts are not retained by the LLMs or used to train them. All retrieved information is based on individual data access and permissions while using Copilot.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>In Microsoft Teams, Copilot’s ability to generate comprehensive meeting summaries is an invaluable tool for task management. It ensures that key discussion points, action items, and decisions made during meetings are documented accurately. This simplifies the process of assigning tasks and responsibilities, tracking progress, and ensuring that important decisions are acted upon promptly.</p>
                <h5 style="font-size: large;">6. Business Efficiency</h5>

                <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
                <h5 style="font-size: large; padding-top: 10px;">1. What is the Cost of Microsoft 365 Copilot?</h5>
                <p style="padding-top: 2px;">Microsoft 365 subscribers who have the E3, E5, Business Standard, and Business Premium customers will pay $30 per user, per month, for Copilot. More details will be released in the future, although the precise availability date has not yet been disclosed.</p>
                <p>Three (3) other factors also prevent Microsoft from making Copilot completely free.</p>
                <p>The business has a history of charging for collaboration tools, to start. Microsoft Office is one such example of a premium membership service.</p>
                <p>Second, Copilot is a strong tool that will make life easier for companies and developers. Copilot would be accessible to everyone if it were free, levelling the playing field and making it more challenging for Microsoft to compete.</p>
                <p>Lastly, Microsoft has made significant investments in the Copilot technology. The business has been developing the service for a while, spending a sizable sum of money on R&D. They’ll probably want to charge for Copilot in order to repay their investment.</p>
                <h5 style="font-size: large; padding-top: 20px;">2. Does Microsoft Copilot Function Offline?</h5>
                <p style="padding-top: 5px;">Without an internet connection, the majority of AI tools—if not all—do not function. Therefore, it is highly possible that Copilot will not function unless you have an internet connection.</p>
